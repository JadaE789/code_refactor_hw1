# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

For this assigment our job was too refactor an already existing code and improve on it. That includes fixing any errors in the code, making it easier to read, and ensuring the site displays and all functions/links work properly. 

For this specific code I only had two corrections in the code to make that reflected on the website. The first one was in the title tag, in the original code it was written just as "website" I decided to change it too "Horiseon". This is the title that displays in the upper tab at the top of the screen. The second correction I had to make was within the nav bar list. The search engine optimaization was in its own class, without that class being declared, I changed this to an ID. I also had to then create a class for this item. The purpose of the navigation bar was so when you clicked on one of the links it would then move down the screen to a short description of those items. 

In terms of the CSS styles, I did add some comments to some of the lines I wasn't sure exactly what the properties did or what they displayed on the website.
